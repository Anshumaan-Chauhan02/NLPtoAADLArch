The charging unit imports electrical energy (EE) and transfers EE to the battery. The battery stores EE during charging and supplies EE during the deviceâ€™s operation. The control unit receives EE from the battery and transfers EE to the motor. The motor converts EE to mechanical energy (ME) and transfers it to the impeller.  The nozzle body imports debris and air from the outside and transfers them to the filter assembly. The valve assembly prevents air flow from the nozzle body to the outside. The grill filter separates large debris particles from the air flow. The HEPA assembly separates small debris particles from the air flow.  The canister stores the debris. The filter assembly transfers the air flow to the intake grill of the drive assembly. The intake grill receives air from and filter assembly and transfers air to the impeller.  The impeller receives air from the intake grill, receives ME from the motor, and adds ME to the air flow. The impeller transfers the air flow to the discharge filter. The discharge filter separates small debris particles from the air flow and transfers the air flow to the discharge grill. The discharge grill exports the air flow to the outside
